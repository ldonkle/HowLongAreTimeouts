							<p>Section 5 Timeouts
CHARGED TEAM TIMEOUTS
Timeouts:
Each Team working Three Timeouts AllowedA team is allowed three charged team timeouts during each half.
Item 2: Length of Timeouts. Charged team timeouts shall be two minutes in length, unless the timeout is
not used by television for a commercial break. Timeouts shall be 30 seconds in length when the
designated number of television commercials have been exhausted in a quarter, if it is a second
charged team timeout in the same dead-ball period, or when the Referee so indicates.
OFFICIAL NFL PLAYING RULES 17
Item 3: Consecutive Team Timeouts. Each team may be granted a charged team timeout during the
same dead-ball period, but a second charged team timeout by either team during the same dead-ball
period is prohibited. Such team timeouts may follow a Referee’s timeout or any automatic timeouts in
Section 4 above.
Item 4: Unsportsmanlike Conduct. An attempt to call an excess team timeout or to call a second
timeout in the same dead-ball period by Team B in an attempt to “freeze” a kicker, will be considered
unsportsmanlike conduct and will subject the offending team to a 15-yard penalty (See 12-3). This will
apply to field goal or Try attempts.
Note: If an attempt is made to call a timeout in such situations, the officials shall not grant a timeout; instead,
play will continue, and a penalty will be called, with customary enforcement. If a timeout is inadvertently
granted, the penalty shall also be enforced. See 12-3-1-v.
INJURY TIMEOUTS
Article 2If an official determines a player to be injured, or if attendants from the bench come on the field to
assist an injured player, an injury timeout will be called by the Referee.
A.R. 4.7   Runner A1 is tackled and appears injured since he does not move.
  Ruling: Official should call timeout for injured player. Official should not try to determine if player is injured.
Timeout is not charged if conditions are not violated.
INJURY TIMEOUTS PRIOR TO TWO-MINUTE WARNING OF EITHER HALF
Article 3When an injury timeout is called, the injured player must leave the game for the completion of one
down. The player will be permitted to remain in the game if:
 (a) either team calls a charged team timeout;
 (b) the injury is the result of a foul by an opponent; or
 (c) the period ends or the two-minute warning occurs before the next snap.
At the conclusion of an injury timeout, the game clock will start as if the injury timeout had not occurred. If either
team takes, or is charged with, a timeout, the clock will start on the snap.
INJURY TIMEOUTS AFTER TWO-MINUTE WARNING OF EITHER HALF
Article 4After the two-minute warning of a half, the following shall apply:
(a) If a team has not used its three charged team timeouts, the team of the injured player will be charged
a team timeout, unless:
 (i) the injury is the result of a foul by an opponent;
 (ii) the injury occurs during a down in which there is a change of possession, a successful field goal,
or an attempted Try; or
 (iii) the opponent calls a timeout.
(b) If a team has used its three charged team timeouts, an excess team timeout shall be called by the
Referee, unless:
 (i) the injury is the result of a foul by an opponent;
 (ii) the injury occurs during a down in which there is a change of possession, a successful field goal,
or an attempted Try; or
 (iii) the opponent calls a timeout.
Penalty: For the second and each subsequent excess team timeout after the two-minute warning:
Loss of five yards from the succeeding spot for delay of the game.
  (c) The player must leave the game for the completion of one down, unless:
 (i) the injury is the result of a foul by an opponent; or
 (ii) either team calls a charged team timeout.
 (d) No yardage penalty will be assessed for the first excess team timeout, but a 10-second runoff of the
game clock may be applicable pursuant to (f) below. At the conclusion of an excess timeout taken
while time is in, the game clock shall start with the ready-for-play signal. For any excess timeout
charged to the defense, the play clock is reset to 40 seconds.
 (e) If the Referee has already called an excess team timeout in that half for a team, any subsequent
excess timeout for that team will result in a five-yard penalty. (Such penalty shall be considered a foul
between downs and will not offset a foul by the defense or be part of a multiple foul by the offense.)
 (f) If an excess team timeout is charged against a team in possession of the ball, and time is in when the
excess timeout is called, the ball shall not be put in play until the time on the game clock has been
reduced by 10 seconds, if the defense so chooses.
OFFICIAL NFL PLAYING RULES 18
A.R. 4.8 Offensive team A, in the last two minutes of the half and the clock running:
 a) Requests its fourth timeout because of an injured player.
Ruling: Granted. No five-yard penalty. Player has to be removed. Ten-second runoff. Ball will not be put in
 play until the Referee blows his whistle and gives the wind-the-clock signal.
 b) Requests its fifth timeout because of an injured player.
Ruling: Granted. Five-yard penalty. Player has to be removed. Ten-second runoff. Ball will not be put in play
until the Referee blows his whistle and gives the wind-the-clock signal.
SUPPLEMENTAL NOTES:
 (1) Either half can end as the result of the 10-second runoff referenced in (f) above.
(2) If an injury timeout is called for both teams during or after a down, charged team timeouts and/or
excess team timeouts are charged as appropriate, but no yardage or 10-second runoff penalties shall
be enforced.
 (3) If a foul by either team occurs during a down in which there is also an injury, such foul does not affect
the charging of an excess timeout, but it does prevent a 10-second runoff that may result from the
excess timeout, because the foul stopped the clock.
 (4) The Competition Committee deprecates feigning injuries, with subsequent withdrawal, to obtain a
timeout without penalty. Coaches are urged to cooperate in discouraging this practice.
 (5) There can never be a 10-second runoff against the defensive team.
 (6) See Rule 16 (Sudden-Death Procedures), Section 1, Article 3 for application to overtime games.
REFEREE’S TIMEOUT
Article 5Provided that calling timeout is not in conflict with another rule, the Referee may suspend play and
stop the clock (Referee’s timeout) at any time without penalty to either team when playing time is being
consumed because of an unintentional delay. Such situations include but are not limited to the following:
 (a) when there is the possibility of a measurement for a first down, or if the Referee is consulting with a
captain about one;
 (b) when there is an undue pileup on the runner, or while determining possession after a fumble while
time is in;
 (c) when there is an undue delay by officials in spotting the ball for the next snap;
 (d) if the snap is made before the officials can assume their positions. See 4-6-5-b if it is a repeated act;
 (e) when there is an injury to an official or member of the chain crew;
 (f) during an officials’ conference (see 15-1-6); or
 (g) while repairing or replacing game equipment, except player equipment.
After a Referee’s timeout, the game clock will start pursuant to Rule 4, Section 3, as if the Referee’s timeout had
not occurred. </p>
